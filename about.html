You are probably not here to here to whole long story about how this business had its birth, so I will tell you the short version.
 Tim and Annie are both passionate hikers and campers, and that is even how they met 10 years ago.
efore they got married and had children they enjoyed many adventures together and on these journeys there was always something missing.
           A decent rain jacket that would keep them comfortable and warm for the entire journey that also had the right quality and design 
at a reasonable price.
           Then they got their first child they could no longer go on as many adventures anymoreand the idea of creating and designing their
own line of jackets grew.They are passionate about the productionand design, and are very proud of the fact that their jackets are also eco-friendly.

              Quality by design centres on the use of multivariate analysis, often in combination with modern process-analytical chemistry methods and knowledge-management tools to enhance the identification and understanding of critical attributes of materials and critical parameters of the manufacturing process. This enhanced understanding of product and process is used to build quality into manufacturing and provide the basis for continuous improvement of products and processes.
