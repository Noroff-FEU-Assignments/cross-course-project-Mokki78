You are probably not here to here to whole
 long story about how this business had its 
birth, so I will tell you the short version.
 Tim and Annie are both passionate hikers 
and campers, and that is even how they 
met 10 years ago.

Before they got married and had children 
they enjoyed many adventures together 
and on these journeys there was always 
something missing.
 A decent rain jacket that would keep them 
comfortable and warm for the entire journey
that also had the right quality and design 
at a reasonable price.

When they got their first child they could no
longer go on as many adventures anymore
and the idea of creating and designing their
own line of jackets grew.
  They are passionate about the production
and design, and are very proud of the fact 
that their jackets are also eco-friendly.

              Quality by design centres on the use of multivariate analysis, often in combination with modern process-analytical chemistry methods and knowledge-management tools to enhance the identification and understanding of critical attributes of materials and critical parameters of the manufacturing process. This enhanced understanding of product and process is used to build quality into manufacturing and provide the basis for continuous improvement of products and processes.
